// Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way.

// The same way you can call a function inside of other functions, you can call a function inside of itself. A function that calls itself is called a recursive function. Recursion is important because you can solve some problems by solving similar sub-problems. Recursive solutions usually have less code and are more elegant that their iterative equivalents if the problem you solve is recursive in nature.

// Let’s take a simple example. To print all the numbers from 1 to N, the first thing we have to do is print all the numbers from 1 to N-1 and then print N.

func printFirstNumbers(_ N: Int) {
    if N > 1 {
        printFirstNumbers(N - 1)
    }
    print(N)
}

printFirstNumbers(3)
// 1
// 2
// 3

// Okay … the example from above works … but what really happens?

// To understand what happens we can take a look at a modified version of the printFirstNumbers function. This version will print all the steps it takes.

func printFirstNumbers2(_ N: Int) {
    print("start printFirstNumbers(\(N))")
    
    if N > 1 {
        print("printFirstNumbers(\(N)) calls printFirstNumbers(\(N-1))")
        
        printFirstNumbers2(N - 1)
    }
    
    print("printFirstNumbers(\(N)) will print \(N)")
    
    print("end printFirstNumbers(\(N))")
}

printFirstNumbers2(3)
// start printFirstNumbers(3)
// printFirstNumbers(3) calls printFirstNumbers(2)
// start printFirstNumbers(2)
// printFirstNumbers(2) calls printFirstNumbers(1)
// start printFirstNumbers(1)
// printFirstNumbers(1) will print 1
// end printFirstNumbers(1)
// printFirstNumbers(2) will print 2
// end printFirstNumbers(2)
// printFirstNumbers(3) will print 3
// end printFirstNumbers(3)

// The computer knows where to continue the execution of printFirstNumbers(2) after printFirstNumbers(1) finishes by using a data structure known as a call stack. The call stack keeps information about the currently active functions. When printFirstNumbers(1) starts executing printFirstNumbers(3) and printFirstNumbers(2) are still active and they need to resume control right after the if statement.

// Notice that printFirstNumbers(1) did not call printFirstNumbers again. That’s known as a base case. You need to have at least one base case inside a recursive function in order to prevent infinite calls – or what is known as stack overflow.

// Let’s take another example. This time instead of printing the numbers from 1 to N let’s do it from N to 1.
// To count from N to 1 all we need to do is print N then print all the numbers from N-1 to 1.

func printFrom(_ N: Int) {
    print(N)
    if N > 1 {
        printFrom(N - 1)
    }
}

printFrom(5)
// 5
// 4
// 3
// 2
// 1
// You can find another example of recursion if you google recursion. The results page will ask you “Did you mean: recursion” which will take you to the same page…

// And here you can find a recursive drawing editor made by Toby Schachman. It’s super easy to use – and a lot of fun. If you didn’t understand what recursion is all about I highly encourage you to take a few minutes to play with it.

// An example image that could be generated using recursive drawing
// Things to remember about recursion:

// you can call a function inside of itself
// you always have at least one base case in order to prevent the function calling itself infinite times
